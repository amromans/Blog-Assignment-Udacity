                    I'm Allison! I am 24 years old. I live in Acworth, Ga. I recently graduated from Kennesaw State University where I got my degree in Software Engineering. I am an aspiring Front End Web Developer. I am currently
                getting a Front End Development nanodegree certification from Udacity. While I was in school, I worked my way by working for Paws n' Claws Pet Care. That job was an absolute blessing!
                <br />
                In my free time, however, I enjoy exercising and exploring new places outdoors. I also found an outlet for my creativity a few years ago by discovering I had a talent for making home decor! Before I knew it, I
                had started a little business where I made and sold my signs and decor. I hope to share some of my creations here soon! <br />
                I also love spending time with my family! We are extremely close. I have a one year old nephew who is my absolute joy!! <br />
                Thank you for visiting my blog! I plan to have more content for you very soon!
