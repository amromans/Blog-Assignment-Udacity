      <h2>Paws n' Claws Pet Care</h2>
      <h6>Working My Way, One Dog at a Time. <br> Feb 8, 2021</h6>
     <!----- <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>-->
      <p> I started petsitting when I was 15. Little did I know I would eventually get the opportunity to work for Paws n' Claws throughout
        my college years. It was always extremely important to me to remain focused on my degree. Any normal job would have taken a lot
        of time and energy away from my studies. Working for Paws n' Claws allowed me the flexability to never have to worry about my pet
        care interfering with studying and classes. 
        <br>  I also learned so much. Believe it or not, pet care requires a lot of flexibility, improvizing, and a lot of responsiblily.
        Not only do clients put a lot of trust into me by allowing me access to their homes but they put a lot of trust into me by having me 
        take care of their animals when they are unable to do so themselves. Majority of pet owners view their pets as children so not only
        does it mean a lot when they trust you to take care of their "babies" for them but it also means a lot of catering to the clients, their
        quirks and preferences as well as their worries and anxieties about their homes and pets while they are gone. Every client and every
        pet is unique and have their own very specific requirements. 
        <br>  I'm sure you'd think it is a pretty easy job but it can actually have its own issues as well that require a lot of thinking on your feet.
        Whether it be stopping a dog fight, getting locked out of houses, animals getting sick, animals getting themselves in a situation
        or even something going wrong with a clients house. That isn't even the half of things I've had happen over the years! Nevertheless,
        it forces you to think on your feets to solve whatever problem you face and to solve it in such a way that you have to tell the client
        as little as possible. It is hard for most clients to leave their animals so it is important they remain worry free about their pets 
        while they are gone. 
        <br>  To say this job was a blessing would be an understatement. This job not only allowed me the income and the flexibility to receive
        my education and properly devote myself to it but it also blessed me with the joy of being around some of the sweetest animals every day.
        I was also about to form amazing relationships with all my clients and learned so much about client relationships and responsibility from them
         over the years.

      <h2>AT&T Summer Externship</h2>
      <h6>Covid Who? My Summer Externship. <br> Feb 2, 2021</h6>
     <!--- <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>--->
      <p> After Covid came about, a lot of internship opportunities were stalled. AT&T Summer Learning Academy provided
        an opportunity for students to participate in a Summer Externship program. We were able to learn and gain insight from many
        different people in different fields about a number of different topics that are valuable to have going into the workforce. 
        This included insights into human resources, exposure into corporate finance and advertising as well as explored media operations and their technologies.
        This externship also provided us with valuable advice and guidance about communication, leadership as well as things like interviews, our resume
        and your professional presentation as a whole.
