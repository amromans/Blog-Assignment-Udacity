# Blog-Assignment-Udacity
This is my blog assignment progress for my Udacity certification (HTML &amp; CSS)

This project requires you to utilize your HTML and CSS skills to build out a personal blog website, 
including custom images, layout, and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, 
you'll work to appropriately structure your files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting & style.
